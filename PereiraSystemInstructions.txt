1- Put "PereiraSystemAI" folder in your AOE2 DE (Dynasties of India) "resources/common/ai" folder

2- Move "PereiraLoader.per" and "PereiraLoader.ai" files out to "resources/common/ai" folder

3- Once inside the game pick the player "PereiraLoader" and it will call the AI inside "PereiraSystemAI" folder

4- Ready for battle!


Best settings:

- Population 150, 175, 200, 225

- Maps like Amazon Tunnel and Black Forest where the attack can be more focused.

Pereira System AI will try to build some cute walls in the lowest difficulty settings sometimes, making it less competitive.

It will create all units up to Dinasties of India expansion except flaming camels cause putting a camel on fire is lame.
